# Stock Classification â€“ CFM Data Challenge

This project was developed as part of the **CFM Data Challenge** at Ã‰cole Centrale de Nantes, focused on classifying stocks from high-frequency trading data. Our team achieved **1st place in the class**.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Classify sequences of tick-level trading data into one of 24 stocks using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## ðŸ§° Methods

- **Feature Engineering**: global statistics, spread features, venue frequency, autocorrelation
- **Models**:
  - Random Forest & XGBoost (tabular format)
  - XGBoost with wide-format features and GPU acceleration
  - **Bi-directional LSTM** â€“ best performance (**Score: 0.4026**)

## ðŸ“Š Results

| Model         | Score   |
|---------------|---------|
| Random Forest | 0.2814 |
| XGBoost v1    | 0.2748 |
| XGBoost v2    | 0.2510 |
| **Bi-LSTM**   | **0.4026** âœ…

## ðŸ›  Tools

- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras  
- Kaggle (for GPU/TPU training)  
- Overleaf (report)
